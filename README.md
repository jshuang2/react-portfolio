## Reflection

When brainstorming how I wanted to build my website, I knew I wanted to keep it as functionally light as possible. In doing so, I decided it would be a frontend only project. In the future, this also allows me to port the create-react-app code into a Gatsby JS project which would make the site perform even faster.

Ultimately, what you see when you visit my website is about a month and a half of work after the completion of University of Washington's coding bootcamp. However, there are still components that can be improved upon. It'll always be a work in progress!
